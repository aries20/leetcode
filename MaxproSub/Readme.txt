So it is similar to Max sum question but here we use three pointer max,min 
and result, we check at every point for min and max and figure out which 
is the max and make changes if max is greater than result

2,3,-2,4
	0  1  2  3
min	2  2 -12 -36
max	2  6 -2	 3

result  2  6  6  6

Here we remember that don't forget to make a temp variable.
