This code is written in Java, and it calculates the longest palindromic substring in a given string. The code has two main functions: longestpalindrome and checkpalindrome.

The longestpalindrome function takes in a string as an input and returns the longest palindromic substring found in that string. It does this by checking for palindromic substrings of different lengths, centered at each character of the input string, using the checkpalindrome function.

The checkpalindrome function takes in a string, and two indices left and right, and returns the length of the longest palindromic substring that is centered between those two indices. The function uses two pointers, left and right, to expand the substring until it is no longer a palindrome or until the pointers reach the bounds of the string.

Finally, the main function prints a "Hello, World!" message and then finds the longest palindromic substring in the string "abbbac".
