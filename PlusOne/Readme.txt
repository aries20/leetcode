This code appears to be a Java implementation of a function that takes an array of integers "digits" representing a non-negative integer, and returns an array of integers representing the integer one greater than the input. It does this by iterating through the elements of the input array starting from the rightmost element, checking if the current element is less than 9. If it is, it increments that element and returns the modified array. If the current element is 9, it sets it to 0 and continues iterating. If the loop completes and all elements are 0, it creates a new array one element longer than the input array and sets the first element to 1, indicating that a carry occurred, and returns this new array.
