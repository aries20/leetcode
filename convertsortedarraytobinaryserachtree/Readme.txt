Whenever given a sorted array try to think of Binary search method
So the problem will be solved using binary search method here
the middle element will the root so we take midde point and then divided it recursively



[ -4,-2,0,4,6,10]

  0   1 2 3 4 5

	0			we are dividing it up in two branches left and right

   -4       6

null  -2  4	10
